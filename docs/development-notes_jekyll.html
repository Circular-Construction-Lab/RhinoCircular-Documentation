<h3 id="updating-gem-files">Updating Gem Files</h3>
<p>Gem files in Jekyll are similar to Python packages, sometimes there are security issues that needs to be updated.
For example, recently I had to update addressable from 2.7.0 to 2.8.0 in order to avoid security issues.
If Ruby starts to complain about this:</p>

<pre><code>Could not find addressable-2.8.0 in any of the sources
Run `bundle install` to install missing gems.
</code></pre>

<p>Then simply run: <code>bundle install</code></p>

<h3 id="controlling-the-order-of-sections">Controlling the order of sections</h3>
<p>Currently, it is a dirty trick, but it works. I cannot get jekyll to work with a single number, so I am using date.
In <strong>_posts</strong>, the date with most recent pops up to the top. For example, <strong>2021_06_30</strong> appears on the top of <strong>2021_06_01</strong>.
It ain’t perfect, but it solves our problem.</p>
