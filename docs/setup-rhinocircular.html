<h2 id="install">Install</h2>
<p>Before you install, you might want to check whether the binary you downloaded is original and complete.
This reduces the risk of installing broken plug-in caused by internet issues during download, or plug-in that is maliciously changed by others.
Just follow this article: <a href="https://support.esri.com/en/technical-article/000020408">How To: How and when to use CheckSum (MD5)</a></p>

<p>There is a directory that Rhino and Grasshopper can see and load Grasshopper plug-ins.
To find this directory, first open up Grasshopper from Rhino, then go to <strong>Special Folders- Component Folder</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="img/development-notes/gh_special_folders_comp_folder.png" alt="drawing" width="700" /></p>

<p>A folder most likely located in <strong>C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\Grasshopper\Libraries</strong> will open. 
This is the place where Grasshopper loads all its plug-ins.</p>

<p>With a peace of mind that your copy of RhinoCircular is original, we can proceed to install.
Drag the <strong>CircularConstruction.gha</strong> into this directory and restart Rhino.
Re-open Grasshopper, and you should be all set.</p>
