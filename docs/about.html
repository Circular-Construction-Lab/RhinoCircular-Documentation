<p>The Circular Construction Lab (CCL) in the Department of Architecture at Cornell AAP houses a design research program that advances the paradigm shift from linear material consumption towards a circular economy within an industrialized construction industry. 
 At the intersection of architecture, engineering, material and computer science, as well as economics, the lab investigates new concepts, methods and processes to</p>

<p>(1) Design and construct buildings as the material depots for future construction. <br />
(2) Activate the potential of the built environment as an ‘urban mine’ for today’s construction.</p>

<p>CCL understands architecture as part of a regenerative and restorative cycle and sees design as a vehicle that can advance this ambition with excellence in teaching and research. 
 Through close collaborations with academic, industrial, and legislative/ political partners the lab ensures the relevance of its work and promotes the direct and full-scale implementation of research results towards a more sustainable, low/ no-carbon, circular construction industry.</p>
